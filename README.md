Time to start something new!
Hi, my name is Zach. 
I'm a 24 year old just getting into coding and software engineering. I was born and raised in Louisville, KY. I've worked since the day I turned 14 in the resturaunt industry and feel as if it is time to make a change to something BIGGER and better!
