Time to start something new
Hi, my name is Zach. I'm a 24 year old just getting into coding and software engineering. I was born and raised in the city of Louisville KY my whole life, I've worked since the day I turned 14 in the resturaunt indstury and feel as if it is time to make a change to something BIGGER and better!
